# Murmurations

## About
An openFrameworks sketch (C++) with a fairly efficient flocking algorithm implementation.
Capable of simulating around 2-10 thousand boids while also recording at 4k and 24 fps on high performance machine.
Utilizes an octree w/ a very limited search depth. 
The limited depth is guided by this [paper](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002894) which suggests starlings only ever look at around 7 other starlings.

The sketch has many controls for color, and the forces acting from and on the boids.

### Examples of animation generated by sketch:

Inspired and guided by Daniel Shiffman's NOC, Reynold's Boids, Turtles Termites and Traffic Jams, and Latour.
